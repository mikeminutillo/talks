# A Picture is worth 1000 lines of code

## Abstract

Large software systems tend to be complex. The recent trend in Microservice Architecture has led to an environment where software systems are made up of collaborating parts that constantly change and evolve. These individual components tend to be simpler but keeping track of how they interact can be a real challenge. If only we could step back and visualize the whole system!

In this session I'll show a variety of tools and techniques to use when visualizing software systems. I will demonstrate these approaches with visualizations of real software systems, including the NDC Sydney 2016 Twitter Leaderboard.
