# I Handle Messages

## Abstract

Microservices rarely work in isolation. They talk. They collaborate. That often means making a remote call, and that's where things start to wrong. Networks go down. Important resources disappear. Remote microservices respond slowly or don't respond at all. Message queueing technologies like RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, and Amazon SQS can help.

In this interactive session, we will build a microservices system using an exclusive technology you can only find at the conference: volunteers from the audience. You will learn why microservices run in to problems when they're built on top of HTTP. We will add message queues to make our microservices architecture more robust and fault tolerant, and look at some other advantages we get too. You will leave the session ready to say "I Handle Messages".
